'''
 Given a non-empty array of integers nums, every element appears twice except for one. Find that single one.
 You must implement a solution with a linear runtime complexity and use only constant extra space.
 
 Example 1:
    Input: nums = [2,2,1]
    Output: 1

Example 2:
    Input: nums = [4,1,2,1,2]
    Output: 4
